  A quick introduction to indexes
  - Suppose you have a book that contains a list of movies.
  - To find a movie with the title Pirates of Silicon Valley, you need to scan every page of the book until you find the match. This is not efficient.

  - If the book has an index that maps titles with page numbers, you can look up the movie title in the index to find the page number:

      Pimpernel' Smith 1
      ...
      Pirates of Silicon Valley 201
      ...
      Twas the Night 300

  - In this example, the movie with the title Pirates of Silicon Valley is located on page 201. Therefore, you can open page 201 to get detailed information about the movie.
  - In this analogy, the index speeds up the search and makes it more efficient.
  - The MongoDB index works in a similar way. To speed up a query, you can create an index for a field of a collection.

  - However, when you insert, update, or delete the documents from the collection, MongoDB needs to update the index accordingly.
  - In other words, an index improves the speed of document retrieval at the cost of additional write and storage space to maintain the index data structure. Internally, MongoDB uses the B-tree structure to store the index.


****************************

  Load sample data
  - We’ll use the movies collection from the mflix sample database to demonstrate how the indexes work in MongoDB.
    + First, download the movies.json file and place it in a folder on your computer e.g., c:\data\movies.json
    + Second, import the movies.json file into the mflix database using the mongoimport tool:

        mongoimport c:\data\movies.json -d mflix -c movies

*/

// By default, all collections have an index on the _id field. To list the indexes of a collection, you use the getIndexes() method with the following syntax:
db.collection.getIndexes()

// In this syntax, the collection is the name of the collection that you want to get the indexes. For example, the following shows the indexes of the movies collection in the mflix database:
db.sales.getIndexes()
/*
  - Output:
      [ { v: 2, key: { _id: 1 }, name: '_id_' } ]

  - The output shows the index name '_id_' and index key _id. The value 1 in the key : { _id : 1 } indicates the ascending order of the _id values in the index.
  - When an index contains one field, it’s called a single field index. However, if an index holds references to multiple fields, it is called a compound index. This tutorial focuses on a single field index.

  Explain a query plan
  - The following query finds the movie with the title Pirates of Silicon Valley :

      db.movies.find({
        title: 'Pirates of Silicon Valley
      })

  - To find the movie, MongoDB has to scan the movies collection to find the match.
  - Before executing a query, the MongoDB query optimizer comes up with one or more query execution plans and selects the most efficient one.
*/
// To get the information and execution statistics of query plans, you can use the explain() method:
db.collection.explain()

// For example, the following returns the query plans and execution statistics for the query that finds the movies with the title Pirates of Silicon Valley:
db.movies
  .find({
    title: 'Pirates of Silicon Valley',
  })
  .explain('executionStats')
/*
  - The explain() method returns a lot of information. And you should pay attention to the following winningPlan:
  ...
      winningPlan: {
        stage: 'COLLSCAN',
        filter: { title: { '$eq': 'Pirates of Silicon Valley' } },
        direction: 'forward'
      },
  ...

  - The winningPlan returns the information on the plan that the query optimizer came up with. In this example, the query planner comes up with the COLLSCAN that stands for the collection scan.
  - Also, the executionStats shows that the result contains one document and the execution time is 9 milliseconds:
  ...
    executionStats: {
      executionSuccess: true,
      nReturned: 1,
      executionTimeMillis: 9,
      totalKeysExamined: 0,
      totalDocsExamined: 23539,
  ...

/*
  Create an index for a field in a collection
*/
// To create an index for the title field, you use the createIndex() method as follows:
db.movies.createIndex({ title: 1 })
/*
  - Output:
      title_1

  - In this example, we pass a document to the createIndex() method. The { title: 1} document contains the field and value pair where:
    + The field is the index key (year).
    + The value describes the type of index for the year field. The value 1 for descending index and -1 for ascending index.
  - The createIndex() method returns the index name. In this example, it returns the title_1 which is the concatenation of the field and value.
*/
// The following query shows the indexes of the movies collection:
db.movies.getIndexes()
/*
  [
    { v: 2, key: { _id: 1 }, name: '_id_' },
    { v: 2, key: { title: 1 }, name: 'title_1' }
  ]

  - The output shows two indexes, one is the default index and another is the year_1 index that we have created.

  *** By default, MongoDB names an index by concatenating the indexed keys and each key’s direction in the index ( i.e. 1 or -1) using underscores as a separator. For example, an index created on { title: 1 } has the name title_1.
*/

// The following returns the query plans and execution statistics for the query that finds the movie with the title Pirates of Silicon Valley:
db.movies.find({
  title: 'Pirates of Silicon Valley',
})
/*
  - This time the query optimizer uses the index scan (IXSCAN) instead of the collection scan (COLLSCAN):
  ...
  winningPlan: {
        stage: 'FETCH',
        inputStage: {
          stage: 'IXSCAN',
          keyPattern: { title: 1 },
          indexName: 'title_1',
          isMultiKey: false,
          multiKeyPaths: { title: [] },
          isUnique: false,
          isSparse: false,
          isPartial: false,
          indexVersion: 2,
          direction: 'forward',
          indexBounds: {
            title: [
              '["Pirates of Silicon Valley", "Pirates of Silicon Valley"]'
            ]
          }
        }
      },
  ...

  - Also, the execution time (executionTimeMillis) was down to almost zero from 2 milliseconds:

  ...
    executionStats: {
      executionSuccess: true,
      nReturned: 1,
      executionTimeMillis: 0,
      totalKeysExamined: 1,
      totalDocsExamined: 1,
  ...
