  Compound Index
  - create a compound index for fields in a collection.

******************

  Introduction to the MongoDB compound indexes
  - A compound index is an index that holds a reference to multiple fields of a collection. In general, a compound index can speed up the queries that match on multiple fields.
  - To create a compound index, you use the createIndex() method with the following syntax:

      db.collection.createIndex({
          field1: type,
          field2: type,
          field3: type,
          ...
      })

  - In this syntax, you specify a document that contains the index keys (field1, field2, field3…) and index types.
  - The type describes the kind of index for each index key. For example, type 1 specifies an index that sorts items in ascending order while -1 specifies an index that sorts items in descending order.

  - MongoDB allows you to create a compound index that contains a maximum of 32 fields.
  - It’s important to understand that the order of the fields specified in a compound index matters.
  - If a compound index has two fields: field1 and field2, it contains the references to documents sorted by field1 first. And within each value of field1, it has values sorted by field2.

  - Besides supporting queries that match all the index keys, a compound index can support queries that match the prefix of the index fields. For example, if a compound index contains two fields: field1 and field2, it will support the queries on:

      field1
      field1 and field2

  - However, it doesn’t support the query that matches the field2 only.

// First, create a compound index on the title and year fields of the movies collection:
db.movies.createIndex({ title: 1, year: 1 }) // title_1_year_1

// Second, find the movies whose titles contain the word valley and were released in the year 2014:
db.movies.find({ title: /valley/gi, year: 2014 }).explain('executionStats')
/*
  ...
        inputStage: {
          stage: 'IXSCAN',
          filter: { title: { '$regex': 'valley', '$options': 'is' } },
          nReturned: 3,
          ...
          indexName: 'title_1_year_1',
          ...
  ...

  - The query uses the index title_1_year_1 instead of scanning the whole collection to find the result.

// Third, find the movies whose titles contain the word valley:
db.movies.find({ title: /valley/gi }).explain('executionStats')
/*
  ...
        inputStage: {
          stage: 'IXSCAN',
          filter: { title: { '$regex': 'valley', '$options': 'is' } },
          nReturned: 21,
          ...j
          indexName: 'title_1_year_1',
          ...
  ...

  - This query matches the title only, not the year. However, the query optimizer still makes use of the title_1_year_1 index.
*/

// Finally, find the movies that were released in the year 2014:
db.movies.find({ year: 2014 }).explain('executionStats')
/*
  ...   
    executionStages: {
        stage: 'COLLSCAN',
        filter: { year: { '$eq': 2014 } },
        nReturned: 1147,
  ...

  - In this example, the query optimizer doesn’t use the title_1_year_1 index but scan the whole collection (COLLSCAN) to find the matches.
